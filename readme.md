## Overview

The project is a website consisting of two main pages. Each page has specific components: one page contains 10 headers, and the other page contains 10 footers. Five of these headers and footers are static (unchanging), while the other five are animated.

Guiding Question:
 - The purpose of the website is to showcase a design concept where headers and footers are prominent features. Headers typically contain navigation links, titles, or branding elements at the top of a webpage. Footers, on the other hand, usually contain supplementary information, contact details, social media links, or other relevant content at the bottom of a webpage. The inclusion of animated footers adds a dynamic and engaging element to the user experience.

### Key Components

- Headers Page:
  - 10 distinct headers showcasing different styles or functionalities.
  - Each header may include navigation menus, logos, search bars, or other relevant content.

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```
